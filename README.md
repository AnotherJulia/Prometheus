# Prometheus - Project Initializer

Welcome to **Prometheus**, your go-to command for kickstarting projects with a modern web development stack. With Prometheus, you can instantly set up a project with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and essential providers, saving you the hassle of manual configuration.

## Features

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building optimized web applications with server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Shadcn UI**: A sleek and modern UI library to give your project a polished look right from the start.
- **Providers Integration**: Ready-to-use integrations with essential providers for authentication, state management, and more.

## Quick Start

To create a new project using Prometheus, simply run the following command:

```bash
npx prometheus-init my-project
```

Replace `my-project` with your desired project name. This command will create a new directory with the project name and set up the initial project structure.

## Installation

Prometheus requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your system.

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: If you haven't installed Node.js and npm, download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a New Project**: Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npx prometheus-init my-project
   ```

   This will create a new project directory named `my-project` and install all necessary dependencies.

## Usage

Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd my-project
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Customization

- **Tailwind CSS**: Customize your design using Tailwind's utility classes in the `tailwind.css` file.
- **Next.js**: Create new pages and components using React in the `app` and `components` directories.
- **Shadcn UI**: Utilize Shadcn UI components for a consistent and modern UI experience.
